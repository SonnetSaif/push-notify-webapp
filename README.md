# Push-Notify-WebApp

A web application for receiving push notifications using **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**. This app demonstrates how to handle notifications in both **foreground** and **background** states.

---

## Features

- **Foreground Notifications**: Handle and display notifications when the app is open.
- **Background Notifications**: Automatically display notifications when the app is in the background or closed.
- **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
- **Service Worker**: Implements a service worker to handle background messages.

---

## Prerequisites

- Firebase project with Cloud Messaging enabled.
- A **VAPID key** from the Firebase Console.
- A modern web browser that supports service workers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Push-Notify-WebApp.git
   cd Push-Notify-WebApp
   ```

2. **Add Firebase Configuration**:
   - Replace the Firebase configuration in `main.js` and `firebase-messaging-sw.js` with your Firebase project credentials.

3. **Add VAPID Key**:
   - Replace `YOUR_VAPID_KEY` in `main.js` with your Firebase VAPID key.

4. **Deploy the App**:
   - Host the app on a web server (e.g., using Firebase Hosting, Netlify, or any static hosting service).

## File Structure

```
Push-Notify-WebApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ firebase-messaging-sw.js  # Service worker for handling background messages
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js                   # Main JavaScript file for foreground logic
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html                # HTML file for the app
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # This file
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Foreground Messages**:
   - When the app is open, notifications are handled using the `onMessage` method in `main.js`.

2. **Background Messages**:
   - When the app is in the background or closed, notifications are handled by the service worker (`firebase-messaging-sw.js`) using the `onBackgroundMessage` method.

3. **Service Worker**:
   - The service worker is registered in `main.js` and is responsible for displaying notifications when the app is not active.

---

## Usage

1. Open the app in a browser.
2. Grant notification permissions when prompted.
3. Send a test notification using the Firebase Console or a backend server.
4. Verify that notifications are displayed in both foreground and background states.
